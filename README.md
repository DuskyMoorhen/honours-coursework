# Honours Coursework

This repository was created as part of the course "Data Analysis in Earth Sciences", taken at Monash University and taught by Andrew Gunn (see: [https://github.com/geomorphlab/medaes](https://geomorphlab.github.io/medaes/)).

## Description

Pavement watering is an urban heat mitigation technique. Experiments were conducted in February 2022 at a carpark at Monash University Clayton Campus, Melbourne, Australia. This repo contains data from these experiments, alongside an extended abstract. The code used to produce the figures used in this abstract is also included.
